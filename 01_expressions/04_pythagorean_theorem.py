# Write a program that asks the user for the lengths of the two perpendicular sides of a right triangle and outputs the length of the third side (the hypotenuse) using the Pythagorean theorem!

# The Pythagorean theorem, named after the ancient Greek thinker, Pythagoras, is a fundamental relation in geometry. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.

# For instance, let's consider a right triangle ABC, with the right angle located at C. According to the Pythagorean theorem:

# BC ** 2 = AB ** 2 + AC ** 2

# Your code should read in the lengths of the sides AB and AC, and that outputs the length of the hypotenuse (BC). You will probably find math.sqrt() to be useful.

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

# Enter the length of AB: 3

# Enter the length of AC: 4

# The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: 5.0a


import math  # Math module import kiya gaya hai taake square root function ka use ho sake

def main():
    # User se AB aur AC ki lengths input le kar unhein floating point numbers mein convert kar rahe hain
    ab: float = float(input("Please enter the length of side AB: "))
    ac: float = float(input("Please enter the length of side AC: "))

    # Pythagoras theorem ke zariye BC (hypotenuse) calculate kar rahe hain
    bc: float = math.sqrt(ab ** 2 + ac ** 2)
    print(f"The calculated length of side BC (hypotenuse) is: {bc}")


# Neeche wala code program ko run karne ke liye zaroori hai
